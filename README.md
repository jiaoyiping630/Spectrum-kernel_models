# Spectrum-kernel_models

This repo is built for a submitted paper concerning the selection of model and preprocessing configuration in near-infrared spectrum calibration.

We'll provide a compact tool for the joint-optimization in customized data.

The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

For our previous work concerning the optimization of preprocessing methods for partial least square regression (PLSR), please check:
